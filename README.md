# Ladle Furnace Unit (LFU) Temperature Prediction - Steel Manufacturing

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Project Domain

In the critical process of steel manufacturing, specifically at the ladle furnace unit (LFU), achieving the correct melt temperature is important for quality and efficiency. The LFU, a vital component in steel processing, faces challenges in accurately forecasting temperatures. Addressing this issue is essential for maintaining the delicate balance of the steel's chemical composition and ensuring optimal processing conditions. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the temperature measurements of the steel melt, which is a crucial step in improving the overall efficiency and output of the LFU operations.
## Business Understanding

The ladle furnace unit (LFU) is a critical component in steel processing that requires precise temperature control to ensure the quality of the final product. Inconsistent temperature readings due to incomplete data present significant challenges, directly impacting the steelâ€™s chemical integrity and the efficiency of the LFU's operations. Our goal is to develop an accurate temperature prediction model to overcome these inconsistencies, ensuring that target temperatures are reliably achieved for each steel batch processed. To this end, we propose to explore a machine learning algorithms, such as LSTM, to identify the most effective solution for robust temperature forecasting in the LFU.
## Data Understanding

The project utilizes an extensive dataset from the ladle furnace unit (LFU), encompassing various aspects of the steel processing cycle. The dataset includes files such as data_gas.csv for purging gases, data_bulk.csv for bulk elements, data_wire.csv for wire supply, along with time-related data and crucial temperature measurements from data_temp.csv. With missing entries in temperature records posing a challenge, the dataset's robustness is vital for developing an accurate predictive model. Preliminary exploratory data analysis and visualization will be employed to assess data quality, uncover patterns, and understand the correlations between the different technological operations and the temperature outcomes.
